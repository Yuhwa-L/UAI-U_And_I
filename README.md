# 💘 AI-Powered Dating App

## 🧠 Overview  
This project is an **AI-driven dating application** that analyzes users’ preferences to provide highly personalized match recommendations.  
During the **register stage**, the system uses **AI-generated personalized questions** based on each user’s basic profile data.  
By analyzing their responses through a machine learning model, the app identifies each user’s unique personality traits and dating preferences — leading to more accurate and meaningful matches.
